# Python Naming Conventions and Best Practices

Python naming conventions are essential to make your code clean, readable, and maintainable. These conventions follow PEP 8, the Python style guide. Below are good practices and examples for each element, including variables, functions, constants, classes, and more.

###### Right naming conventions
```
myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"
```

##### Wrong naming conventions
```
2myvar = "John"
my-var = "John"
my var = "John"
```


## 1. Variables
- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
- A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
- Use `snake_case` (lowercase with underscores).
- Make names descriptive and meaningful.
- Avoid single-letter or overly abbreviated names.

## 2. Functions
- Use `snake_case`.
- Use verbs to describe actions.
- Keep names short but meaningful.

## 3. Constants
- Use `UPPER_CASE` with underscores.
- Signify values that should not change.

## 4. Classes
- Use `PascalCase` (uppercase letters for each word, no underscores).
- Use nouns to represent entities.

## 5. Modules and Packages
- Use `snake_case`.
- Keep names short and meaningful.

## 6. Method Names in Classes
- Use `snake_case`.
- Use verbs to describe actions.

## 7. Private Variables and Methods
- Prefix with a single underscore (`_`).
- Indicate internal use within a class or module.

## 8. Dunder (Double Underscore) Methods
- Use double underscores before and after the method name.
- Reserved for special methods (e.g., `__init__`).

## 9. Global Variables
- Use sparingly and name with `UPPER_CASE`.
- Avoid global variables for better modularity.

## 10. Exception Names
- Use `PascalCase`.
- Usually end with `Error`.

## 11. Type Hints
- Use type hints for variables, function arguments, and return types.
- Improve readability and error detection.

## 12. Docstrings
- Include docstrings for modules, classes, methods, and functions.
- Use triple double-quotes to document functionality.

## 13. Acronyms in Names
- Use uppercase for acronyms at the start of names.
- Use lowercase for acronyms within names.

## 14. General Good Practices
- Use meaningful and descriptive names.
- Follow the DRY principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself) to avoid duplicate logic.

## 15. Naming Conventions for Parameters and Arguments
- **Default Parameters:** Use simple and descriptive names. Avoid mutable types like lists or dictionaries as default parameter values to prevent unexpected behavior.
- **Keyword Arguments:** Ensure keyword argument names are clear and match the function’s documentation.

## 16. Inline Comments
- Keep inline comments brief and focused. Use them sparingly to clarify complex code, not to restate the obvious.

## 17. Module Imports
- Import modules at the top of the file.
- Group imports into three categories: standard library imports, related third-party imports, and local application/library-specific imports.
- Use `import` statements in the following order:
    1. Standard library imports.
    2. Related third-party imports.
    3. Local application/library-specific imports.
- Avoid wildcard imports (`from module import *`), as they make it harder to track what’s being used.

## 18. Aliasing Imports
- Use clear and standard aliases (e.g., `import numpy as np` or `import pandas as pd`).

## 19. Naming Conventions for Test Functions and Methods
- Use `snake_case` and name test functions/methods to reflect the behavior being tested.
- Prefix test method names with `test_`.

## 20. File Naming
- Use `snake_case` for file names, keeping them descriptive and succinct.
- Avoid using numbers or special characters in file names, unless they help in versioning or ordering.

## 21. Naming Conventions for Enums
- Use `PascalCase` for the enum class name.
- Use `UPPER_CASE` for enum members.

## 22. Avoid Redundant Naming
- Avoid using redundant words in names that do not add meaningful information (e.g., `data_list` when `data` would suffice if it's clear it’s a list).

## 23. Avoid Overloading Built-in Names
- Avoid naming variables or functions with the same name as Python built-ins (e.g., `list`, `dict`, `str`, etc.).

## 24. Use Meaningful and Consistent Naming Conventions Across the Project
- Consistency in naming across your project improves readability and maintainability.
- Stick to one naming convention and apply it consistently, especially in collaborative environments.

## 25. Lambda Functions
- For complex operations, prefer defining a function with a descriptive name over using a lambda.
- If using a lambda, ensure its use is simple and clear.

## 26. Naming Conventions for Decorators
- Decorators should follow `snake_case`.
- If the decorator modifies behavior, make sure the name reflects this (e.g., `@retry_on_failure`).

## 27. Avoid Ambiguous Abbreviations
- Use clear, unambiguous abbreviations if necessary. Avoid abbreviating names to the point where they become unclear or confusing.

## 28. Separation of Concerns in Naming
- Ensure that names reflect the single responsibility principle, where each variable, function, or class does one thing, and the name clearly represents that responsibility.

## 29. Variable Shadowing
- Avoid reusing names in nested scopes (e.g., a loop variable with the same name as a global variable), which can cause confusion.

## 30. Using `_` for Unused Variables
- Use `_` for variables that are intentionally unused, especially in loops or unpacking operations.

## 31. Explicit is Better Than Implicit
- When naming, prioritize explicitness, making the code easier to understand at a glance. This aligns with the Zen of Python philosophy.
