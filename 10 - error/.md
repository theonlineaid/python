Here is a markdown file with Python's exception types organized for easy reference.


# Python Exception Types

## Base Exception
- **`BaseException`**: The base class for all exceptions.

## Common Exception Types
1. **SystemExit**
   - Raised by the `sys.exit()` function to stop the interpreter.

2. **KeyboardInterrupt**
   - Raised when the user hits the interrupt key (Ctrl+C or Delete).

3. **GeneratorExit**
   - Raised when a generator or coroutine is closed.

## Standard Error Types
4. **Exception**
   - Base class for all built-in exceptions except `SystemExit`, `KeyboardInterrupt`, and `GeneratorExit`.

5. **ArithmeticError** *(Base Class)*
   - **`OverflowError`**: Raised when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be expressed within the allowed range.
   - **`ZeroDivisionError`**: Raised when division or modulo by zero takes place for all numeric types.
   - **`FloatingPointError`**: Raised when a floating-point operation fails.

6. **AssertionError**
   - Raised when an `assert` statement fails.

7. **AttributeError**
   - Raised when an invalid attribute reference is made.

8. **BufferError**
   - Raised when a buffer-related operation cannot be performed.

9. **EOFError**
   - Raised when the `input()` function hits an end-of-file condition.

10. **ImportError** *(Base Class)*
    - **`ModuleNotFoundError`**: Raised when a module could not be found.

11. **LookupError** *(Base Class)*
    - **`IndexError`**: Raised when a sequence subscript is out of range.
    - **`KeyError`**: Raised when a dictionary key is not found.

12. **MemoryError**
    - Raised when an operation runs out of memory.

13. **NameError** *(Base Class)*
    - **`UnboundLocalError`**: Raised when a local variable is referenced before assignment.

14. **OSError** *(Base Class)*
    - **`BlockingIOError`**: Raised when an operation would block on an object.
    - **`ChildProcessError`**: Raised when an operation on a child process failed.
    - **`ConnectionError`**: Base class for network connection errors.
        - **`BrokenPipeError`**
        - **`ConnectionAbortedError`**
        - **`ConnectionRefusedError`**
        - **`ConnectionResetError`**
    - **`FileExistsError`**: Raised when trying to create a file or directory that already exists.
    - **`FileNotFoundError`**: Raised when a file or directory is requested but doesn't exist.
    - **`InterruptedError`**: Raised when a system call is interrupted.
    - **`IsADirectoryError`**: Raised when a file operation (e.g., open) is requested on a directory.
    - **`NotADirectoryError`**: Raised when a directory operation is requested on something that is not a directory.
    - **`PermissionError`**: Raised when trying to perform an operation without the necessary access rights.
    - **`ProcessLookupError`**: Raised when a process is not found.
    - **`TimeoutError`**: Raised when a system function times out.

15. **ReferenceError**
    - Raised when a weak reference proxy is used to access a garbage collected referent.

16. **RuntimeError** *(Base Class)*
    - **`NotImplementedError`**: Raised when an abstract method that needs to be implemented is not.
    - **`RecursionError`**: Raised when the maximum recursion depth is exceeded.

17. **StopIteration**
    - Raised when the next() function of an iterator doesnâ€™t point to any object.

18. **SyntaxError** *(Base Class)*
    - **`IndentationError`**: Raised when there is an incorrect indentation.
        - **`TabError`**: Raised when there is an inconsistency in tabs and spaces in indentation.

19. **SystemError**
    - Raised when the interpreter finds an internal error, but the situation does not look so serious to raise a `SystemExit`.

20. **TypeError**
    - Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.

21. **ValueError**
    - Raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value.
    - **`UnicodeError`**: Base class for Unicode-related errors.
        - **`UnicodeDecodeError`**
        - **`UnicodeEncodeError`**
        - **`UnicodeTranslateError`**

22. **Warning** *(Base Class)*
    - **`DeprecationWarning`**
    - **`PendingDeprecationWarning`**
    - **`RuntimeWarning`**
    - **`SyntaxWarning`**
    - **`UserWarning`**
    - **`FutureWarning`**
    - **`ImportWarning`**
    - **`UnicodeWarning`**
    - **`BytesWarning`**
    - **`ResourceWarning`**

Certainly! Here are various types of errors in Python, each with an example:


# Most common error types in python


### 1. **SyntaxError**
Occurs when Python encounters invalid syntax.
```python
# Example
if True
    print("Missing colon after 'if' statement")
```

### 2. **IndentationError**
Occurs when the indentation is incorrect.
```python
# Example
def my_function():
print("Indentation is required here")
```

### 3. **TypeError**
Occurs when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.
```python
# Example
result = 'Hello' + 5  # Cannot concatenate string and integer
```

### 4. **NameError**
Occurs when a variable or function name is not defined.
```python
# Example
print(undeclared_variable)  # undeclared_variable is not defined
```

### 5. **IndexError**
Occurs when accessing an index that is out of range in a list or tuple.
```python
# Example
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(my_list[5])  # Index 5 is out of range
```

### 6. **KeyError**
Occurs when trying to access a dictionary key that does not exist.
```python
# Example
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
print(my_dict['c'])  # Key 'c' does not exist in the dictionary
```

### 7. **AttributeError**
Occurs when trying to access or call an attribute or method that does not exist on an object.
```python
# Example
my_string = "Hello"
my_string.append(' World')  # Strings do not have an 'append' method
```

### 8. **ZeroDivisionError**
Occurs when dividing a number by zero.
```python
# Example
result = 10 / 0  # Division by zero is not allowed
```

### 9. **FileNotFoundError**
Occurs when trying to open a file that does not exist.
```python
# Example
with open('non_existent_file.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()  # File does not exist
```

### 10. **ValueError**
Occurs when a function receives an argument of the right type but inappropriate value.
```python
# Example
int('abc')  # 'abc' cannot be converted to an integer
```

### 11. **ImportError**
Occurs when trying to import a module that does not exist.
```python
# Example
import non_existent_module  # Module does not exist
```

### 12. **OverflowError**
Occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be represented.
```python
# Example
import sys
print(sys.maxsize * sys.maxsize)  # Might cause overflow
```

### 13. **TypeError**
Occurs when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type (again, shown here for completeness).
```python
# Example
result = 'Hello' - 5  # Cannot subtract an integer from a string
```

### 14. **RuntimeError**
Occurs when an error is detected that doesn't fall into any other category.
```python
# Example
raise RuntimeError("This is a runtime error")  # Manual raise of RuntimeError
```

These examples should cover a wide range of common Python errors you might encounter.

Each of these errors helps to identify issues in your code, making debugging easier.

## Summary
There are numerous exceptions in Python, but they all derive from the BaseException class. The above list covers the most common built-in exceptions. These can be extended by creating user-defined exceptions.
