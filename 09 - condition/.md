# Python Conditionals Examples

## 1. Basic `if` Statement
```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
```

## 2. `if-else` Statement
```python
x = 4
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
```

## 3. `if-elif-else` Statement
```python
x = 8
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
elif x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5 but not greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")
```

## 4. Nested `if` Statements
```python
x = 7
if x > 5:
    if x < 10:
        print("x is between 5 and 10")
```

## 5. Short-hand `if` (Ternary Operator)
```python
x = 3
print("x is greater than 5") if x > 5 else print("x is not greater than 5")
```

## 6. Using `and`, `or`, and `not` Operators
```python
x = 10
y = 20

if x > 5 and y > 15:
    print("Both conditions are True")

if x > 15 or y > 15:
    print("At least one condition is True")

if not x > 15:
    print("x is not greater than 15")
```

## 7. Checking Membership with `in`
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
if "banana" in fruits:
    print("Banana is in the list of fruits")
```

## 8. `pass` in `if` Statement
```python
x = 3
if x > 5:
    pass  # This block intentionally left empty
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
```


This way you can check the python logic.
