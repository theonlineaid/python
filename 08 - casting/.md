# Python Type Casting

Type casting in Python refers to the conversion of one data type into another. Below are examples of type casting in Python:

## Casting to `int`

### From float to int

```python
x = int(10.7)
# x will be 10
```

### From string to int (if the string is numeric)

```python
x = int("42")
# x will be 42
```

## Casting to `float`

### From int to float

```python
x = float(10)
# x will be 10.0
```

### From string to float (if the string is numeric)

```python
x = float("3.14")
# x will be 3.14
```

## Casting to `str`

### From int to str

```python
x = str(10)
# x will be '10'
```

### From float to str

```python
x = str(10.5)
# x will be '10.5'
```

## Casting to `list`

### From string to list

```python
x = list("hello")
# x will be ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
```

### From tuple to list

```python
x = list((1, 2, 3))
# x will be [1, 2, 3]
```

## Casting to `tuple`

### From list to tuple

```python
x = tuple([1, 2, 3])
# x will be (1, 2, 3)
```

## Casting to `set`

### From list to set

```python
x = set([1, 2, 3, 3])
# x will be {1, 2, 3}
```

## Casting to `dict`

### From list of tuples to dict

```python
x = dict([("key1", "value1"), ("key2", "value2")])
# x will be {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
```

These examples illustrate how you can cast between different data types in Python, depending on your needs.
